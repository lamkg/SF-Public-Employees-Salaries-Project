This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
Import the library that I will be using. 

```{r}
glimpse(sf_salaries)
```

Use glimpse to see the size of the data frame. Now I see that there are 312,882 rows and 9 columns. This means that deleting rows if there is missing data will be acceptable since the sample size is so large. 


The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
